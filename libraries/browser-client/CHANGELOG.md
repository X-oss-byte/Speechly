- Update documentation

## 2.6.2
Wed, 14 Dec 2022 12:04:27 GMT

### Patches

- BrowserClient.initialize() immediately throws a sane error and sets the client to FAILED state if called offline. User-initiated BrowserClient.close() is performed immediately, without waiting for backend to acknowledge. This eliminates confusing errors when called offline. Fixed resuming listening after offline call to BrowserClient.close(). Added an already stopped check to BrowserClient.stopStream() to prevent confusing downstream errors.

## 2.6.0

## 2.4.2
Thu, 11 Aug 2022 18:23:12 GMT

### Patches

- Fixed honoring user-initiated startStream(). It should keep streaming audio to AudioProcessor to be able to send historyFrames upon start(). The stream was incorrectly paused upon call to stop(), which should only happen for automatically started streams when VAD is not in use.

## 2.4.1
Tue, 14 Jun 2022 13:51:56 GMT

### Patches

- Source sample rate was reset upon startStream causing Firefox and Safari to send 44kHz data instead of downsampling it to 16kHz."

- Word offsets are in relation to stream start. This is equal to time within audio context when not using VAD.

### Patches

- Fixed reconnecting after websocket close

## 2.2.0
Tue, 31 May 2022 10:24:53 GMT

### Minor changes

- BrowserClient.uploadAudioData() returns an array of Segments as the result. Upload throttling is used to ensure that the backend can keep up. BrowserClient.stopStream() now waits for last stopContext to arrive.

## 2.1.1
Mon, 30 May 2022 07:18:04 GMT

## 1.4.0
Mon, 28 Feb 2022 08:02:56 GMT

### Minor changes

- startContext and stopContext can be called regardless of ClientState, and they will bring the client to ClientState.Recording and ClientState.Connected unless there was an unrecoverable error (ClientState.Failed). More graceful websocket close handling."

## 1.3.0
Thu, 10 Feb 2022 14:03:08 GMT

### Minor changes

- Exposed 'connect()' method for manual connect. The constructor can be passed 'connect: false' to skip auto-connect. 'startContext()' calls 'initialize()' calls 'connect()' if not done so earlier manually.
- Deprecated language ClientOptions parameter. Language is a property of the appId so the backend knows it."

### Patches

- Client.ts to govern reconnecting - using exponential reconnect delay.

## 1.2.0
Fri, 28 Jan 2022 11:38:16 GMT

### Minor changes
